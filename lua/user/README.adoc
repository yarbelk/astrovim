== Getting Started


I have no idea; but this goes in `~/.config/nvim/lua/user/`


== Configuration

plugins are setup in plugin/<anything>.lua

they use the https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-plugin-spec[Lazy] config system.

Examples of use are 

 - https://code.mehalter.com/AstroNvim_user/~files/master/plugins/codeium.lua
 - https://github.com/kabinspace/AstroNvim_user/blob/master/plugins/init.lua

You need to ensure the plugins are loaded; for example by setting lazy to false or through the ft trigger (file type).

Still figuring out the other bits and bobs
